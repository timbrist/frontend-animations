# Story Line Animation 



the difficult parts: 
1. you need to understand how to draw a line using svg path.
2. you have to understand the pinned section animation.

# Collage Animation
Actually, I like the layout of the collage, but I need some animations in real production to make it looks serious. 

this animation we need to consider 3 parts:
1. set the image position and scroll to different position.
2. click different image other than the center one, should use the GSAP flip plugin.
3. since we define the image position and size, we need to use the GSAP scale animation.

# Mask Animation
Usually this is used at the first entry of the webpage. 
the scale arugument will be different base on the text and screen. 
use the meta tag to indicate the content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" is important for the mobile screen.
